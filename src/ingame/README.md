# What to do at the begining of a party?
1. Press Ctrl + F to disable the numeric frames-per-second and latency display
2. Press I to show the Interface Visibility menu
3. Disable Scoreboard, Time Controls, Chat and Objective Timers

- What's does we disable the Scoreboard? Because when we switch between the "combat" view using the Q key and between the main view, if these options are not configured like this, the scoreboard will not be shown after using the O key to show back the main view. Same thing when we re-focus the LoL Client window, the scoreboard will automaticaly disappeare by default.
